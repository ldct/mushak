<li><b>How do I configure Mooshak with SELinux</b></li>


Restrictions enforced by SELinux are registered in a log file, suc as  <code>/var/log/audit/audit.log</code>.

Using the tools <code>audit2why</code> and </code>audit2allow</code>
you can analyze and create a module with a security policy that can be
added with the command line: 

<pre> semodule â€“i </pre>

Here is a policy file for Mooshak


<pre>
module mooshak 1.0;

 

require {

    type home_root_t;

    type httpd_sys_script_t;

    class file { setattr read create ioctl write getattr unlink open append };

    class dir { setattr read create write rmdir remove_name open add_name };

}

#============= httpd_sys_script_t ==============

allow httpd_sys_script_t home_root_t:dir { setattr read create write rmdir remove_name open add_name };

allow httpd_sys_script_t home_root_t:file { setattr read create
getattr write ioctl unlink open append };

</pre>

<li><b>I get a server error after accessing Mooshak's initial page</b></li>

This probably means that your Apache configuration does not support a
/cgi-bin/ directory for users. To allow programs to be executed in
this directory you should include these lines in the Apache
configuration file e restart the server. 

<pre>
&lt;Directory /home/*/public_html/cgi-bin>
     Options +ExecCGI -Includes -Indexes
     SetHandler cgi-script
&lt/Directory>
</pre>


<li><b>When I use the save command in the admin's screen I get an error message</b></li>

Mooshak's scripts and data files are installed in a certain OS
user's home - by default <code>mooshak</code> - and the CGI scripts should run
with the same user. The <code>suexec</code> module of Apache runs
CGI scripts in users directories as the corresponding and ensures that
scripts cannot be invoked by other users. Mooshak expects
<code>suexec</code> in order to run properly.

<p>If you have this kind of error then you probably don't have
<code>suexec</code> installed. Some distributions install
<code>suexec</code> by default when you install Apache. Sometimes you
may need to recompile Apache with a certain configuration</p>


<p>Of course that you can just give all permissions to all data files by
executing <code>chmod -R 777 data</code> command in Mooshak's home
directory but I advise you against it. You will be compromising your
contest security. 


<li><b> I am using Fedora Core 3 and when Mooshak calls gcc to compile C/C++
  programs it produces either Internal Error or SegFault, but the
  programs compile on the shell</b></li>

People using Mooshak reported that starting Apache in init.d, i.e.,
<code>httpd start</code>, intead of <code>startssl</code> solved this
problem. Apparently this script sets important environment variables
