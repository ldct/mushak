<li><b>I have a submission that Mooshak classifies as ... but when I
run it on the shell it works just fine </b>

In Mooshak executions are similar to those you launch from the command
line, but you have to have in mind that Mooshak uses a safe execution
command to execute you program as an underprivileged user. To have
exactly the same type of execution you use the following command line

<pre>

	~mooshak/bin/safeexec --exec $COMMAND_LINE

</pre>

In fact Mooshak invokes <code>safexec</code> with more command line
options to enforce limits over system resources (memory, time, etc),
but with  this command line you may find, for instance, that your
program requires certain environment variables that are not available
to the <code>safeexec</code> user.
<p>
Also, if you copy data files for the test vectors using the clipboard 
(CUT-PAST) that were produced in Windows then you should be aware that
Mooshak runs in Linux and this system uses a single end-of-file
character, instead of the sequence used by Windows.
