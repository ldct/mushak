<ul>

<li><b>I want to prevent people from registering in a contest</b>

<p>After version 1.3 email registering is switched off by default. As
admin you can to set the <b>Register</b> field in the contest folder
to control email registation.<p>


<p>In versions before 1.3, you can disable registration by removing the
<code>register</code> command from the guest profile. To manage the
guest profile open the <code>config/profiles/guest</code> folder in
the admin interface, them select the <code>register</code> item in the
<b>Authorized</b> selector.</p>

</li>

<li><b>Registration seams to be working but emails are not being sent</b>

To be able to send email the server must have <code>sendmail</code>
installed and configured. In the <code>mail_log</code> file in the 
<code>contests/<i>your_contest</i>/groups<code> folder you should find
a pair of lines for each registration, the first written when Mooshak
started sending the message and the last when it terminated. 

<pre>
22.11.2004 18:31:38: sending to zp@ncc.up.pt
22.11.2004 18:31:38: OK sent to zp@ncc.up.pt.
</pre>

If an error occurs during this phase then the second line will have
the error message generated by the <code>sendmail</code>.
