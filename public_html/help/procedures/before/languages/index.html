<h3>Programming languages allowed</h3>


<p align="justify">Inside the folder for the contest you are setting
up, open the languages folder and do the following:

<ol>
<li><p align="justify"><b>Add new language</b> give a name (usually
the language name) to a new folder for the language you are
defining.<p>

<p align="justify">By default, you already have four languages set (C,
Pascal, C++ and Java). If these are enough for you then you can
advance directly to the next step.

<li><p align="justify"><b>(Re-)Define attributes for a language:</b>
open a language folder, say the <tt>C</tt> folder, and re-define the
attributes as necessary. Pay close attention to the extension-name and
compilation flags. These should preferably be the same as those used
by the teams (the teams should be aware of the compilation flags used;
they should be explicit in the Mooshak FAQ and documentation given to
teams).

</ol>

<p align="justify">Repeat the above steps for each programming
language you want to use in the contest.

<p align="justify">Note that if you have previously setup some other
contest that used the same set of programming languages and
corresponding configuration, then you can reuse the previous definition
by copying the <tt>languages</tt> folder from that contest and and pasting it
within the new contest folder. First, you may have to remove the
default languages folder created by the system for the new contest.
