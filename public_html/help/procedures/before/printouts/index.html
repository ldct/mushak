<h3>Printing command</h3>

<p align="justify">In some contests it is reasonable to allow the
teams to print their programs so that they can debug their programs
offline. Mooshak allows you to define a printing command in which you
specify the printer that should be used for the contest. To this do
the following:

<p align="justify">Inside the folder for the contest you are setting
up, open the <tt>Printouts</tt> folder and then define the
<tt>Command</tt> attribute with the printing command line that should
be used by the system when contestants try to print program listings.

<p align="justify">
The command line must include a reference to the file to be printed
using the variable <b><code>$Programa</code></b>. Other avaliable variables
may be usefull if you want to print a cover page. The following table
lists all the available variables.

<p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
	<td><b><code>$Equipa</code></b></td>
	<td>Name of the <b>team</b> requesting the printout</td></tr>
</tr>
<tr>
        <td><b><code>$Problema</code></b></td>
	<td>Reference of the <b>problem</b> being solved</td>
</tr>
        <td><b><code>$Programa</code></b></td>
	<td>File containing the <b>program</b> to be printed</td>
</tr>
        <td><b><code>$Tempo</code></b></td>
	<td><b>Time</b> counted from the start of the contest</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>

The distribution includes a printing command that produces a cover
page. To use this command relace the command line with 
<pre>
/home/mooshak/bin/imprime.pl $Equipa $Problema $Programa $Tempo
