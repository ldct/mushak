<h3>Adding groups and teams</h3>


<p align="justify">Teams are usually created inside groups. Groups can
be viewd as an Institution or a Country, and all teams inside a group
share the same group-attributes (group nickname, display-colour, and
country flag).

<p align="justify">Inside the folder for the contest you are setting
up, open the <tt>Groups</tt> folder and then to create groups and
teams you can either do it <a href="#stepbystep">step by step</a> or
else by <a href="#importing">importing data from a file</a>.<p>

<hr>

<a name="stepbystep"></a><b>Step by step:</b>


<ol>
<li><p align="justify"><b>Add new group</b> give a name to a new folder
for the group under which some teams will be created.<p>

<li><p align="justify"><b>Define attributes for the group:</b> open
the group folder and define its attributes. Note that, designation
stands for full group name as will appear in the certificates (usually
University names), nickname is an abbreviation of the group name that
will be prefixed to the team name displayed in the submissions list
and classification interfaces. You can also define a display colour
and country flag that all teams inside this group will share.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Add new team</b> the last attribute within a
group definition allows one to give a name to a new folder to hold a
team data.<p>

<li><p align="justify"><b>Define attributes for a team:</b> open the
team folder and define its attributes. You can define the name for the
team, the keyword that the team must use to access the system during
the contest (this keyword can be automatically generated with button
<tt>Create Keyword</tt>), email for the team (relevant for online
contests), and state whether the team qualifies for the official
contest.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Add a team member</b> the last attribute within a
team definition allows one to give a name to a new folder to hold a
team-member data.<p>

<li><p align="justify"><b>Define attributes for a team-member:</b>
open the team-member folder and define its attributes. You can define
the name of the team-member, specify whether he his a contestant or a
coach, specify its sex (relevant for certificates), specify date he
was born and last specify his email-address.

</ol>

<p align="justify">You have to repeat 
<ul>
<li>steps 5 and 6 to create all members within a team;
<li>steps 3 and 4 to create all teams within a group (and then steps 5 and 6);
<li>steps 1 and 2 to create all different groups there will be in the contest (and then repeat steps 3 till 6 as necessary).
</ul>

<p align="justify">This process is cumbersome if you are adding too
many groups and teams. In such case, we advice that you use the
following alternative.

<a name="importing"></a><p align="justify"><b>Importing data from a file:</b>

<p align="justify">Mooshak allows data describing groups and teams to be imported from a text file. In order to it, open the <tt>Groups</tt> folder and then press the button <tt>Import</tt> and give the file name.

<p align="justify">The file being imported must be a text file with
fields separated by tabs and must obbey the format supported by the
ICPC central database, that is:

<pre>
	GlobalId LocalId Role Name Institution Team 
</pre>

<p align="justify">Last, Mooshak also allows you export into a text
file the data describing the participating teams. This feature may be
of interest in case you need to do further processing on that data,
namely produce labels for team-envelopes or produce a team-list for
registration purposes.

<p align="justify">In case you need to reuse the same team-data from a
previous contest you can either export it into a file and import the
file into the new contest, or else make use of folder copy/past
facility provided by Mooshak.
