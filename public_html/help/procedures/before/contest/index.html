In order to create a new programming contest, the following steps are
mandatory:

<ol>
<li><b>Login:</b> login into Mooshak as user <tt>admin</tt>. This
leads you the Administration view of the system, meaning that you can
see and touch everything within the system.<p>

<li><b>Contest folder name:</b> open the <tt>Contests</tt> folder and
then give a name to a new folder that will contain all the data for
your contest.<p>

<li><b>Define attributes of new contest:</b> open the folder you
just created, under the <tt>Contests</tt> folder, and define the
following attributes: a designation for your contest, who is
organizing it, email of contact for the organization (mandatory for
online contests), day and hour for starting and terminating the contest.<p>

</ol>

Now, you are ready to proceed to define the programming languages
allowed in the contest.
