<h3>Problem set</h3>


<p align="justify">The problem set in Mooshak comprehends the
definition of problem descriptions in html, figures referenced within
the html file, input and output test cases and official solutions for
the problem. Each problem resides in a separate folder.

<p align="justify">Inside the folder for the contest you are setting
up, open the <tt>Problems</tt> folder and then to create the problem
set you can either do it <a href="#stepbystep">step by step</a> or
else by <a href="#importing">importing from a tar-file</a>.<p>

<hr>

<a name="stepbystep"></a><b>Step by step:</b>


<ol>
<li><p align="justify"><b>Add new problem</b> give a name to a new folder
for the problem we are going to define.<p>

<li><p align="justify"><b>Define attributes for the problem:</b> open
the problem folder and define its attributes. The name you give to
problem is the used in the Contestants interface and also in the
submissions and classification views. Usually, the names are capital
letters or numbers. The <tt>Wording</tt> attribute is where you should
specify the html-file for this problem. The <tt>Program</tt> attribute
allows you to specify a program source file that is a solution for
this problem. Lastly, you can specify the time limit (<tt>Timeout</tt>
attribute) for this problem. The time limit can be confirmed by the
system once a solution program is given, just press the <tt>Test</tt>
button.

<p align="justify">To complete the problem definition, you need to
specify the test cases and images for the html-file within folders
<tt>Tests</tt> and <tt>Images</tt>. Each test case should reside in a separate folder.


<li><p align="justify"><b>Add new test case</b> open the
<tt>Tests</tt> folder and then give a name to a new folder where the
input and out test files will be stored. For example, if you are
defining the first test case of problem <tt>A</tt>, then call the
first test case folder <tt>A1</tt>.<p>

<li><p align="justify"><b>Upload the input and output test files:</b> open the
test case folder and specify the test files for input and output.

</ol>

<p align="justify">You have to repeat 
<ul>
<li>steps 3 and 4 to create all test cases for a given problem;
<li>steps 1 and 2 to create all problems to be used in the contest (and then repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary).
</ul>

<p align="justify">Please note that at every interface where you can
upload a file (say a problem description, a program solution or input
and output test files) you also have the opportunity to edit those
files within Mooshak, once they have been uploaded. This gives
administrators greater freedom to make quick fixes if necessary.

<p align="justify">A faster process to add the problem set data into Mooshak is by doing the following.

<a name="importing"></a><p align="justify"><b>Importing data from a tar-file:</b> 

<p align="justify">Mooshak allows data describing the problem set to
be imported from a tar-file. In order to it, open the
<tt>Problems</tt> folder and then press the button <tt>Import</tt> and
give the file name.

<p align=justify">The tar-file being imported must group the files
that make the problem set in a directory hierarchy as expect by
Mooshak. For example, a tar-file for a problem set with 2 problems (A
and B) with 2 test cases each would produce a directory hierarchy as
follows (file names are just indicative):

<pre>
A:
  a.html
  a.c
  Images:
    a1.gif
    a2.gtif
  Tests:
    A1:
     in.1
     out.1
    A2:
     in.2
     out.2
B:
  b.html
  b.c
  Images:
    b.gif
  Tests:
    B1:
     input.1
     output.1
    B2:
     input.2
     output.2
</pre>

<p align="justify">Last, Mooshak also allows you export the problem set into an XML file (????).
