active state within the administrator's <a
href="../../interfaces/control/">control interface</a> and the
start-time defined in the <a href="../before/">contest attributes</a>
is reached. Once the contest is started, the top-left corner of
mooshak's interface shows the remaining time left till the end of the
contest.

<p align="justify">The main tasks during the contest are related with
judging. Contestants submissions are validated by person judges and
therefore the people acting as judges must be logged in the system with
judge-accounts.
