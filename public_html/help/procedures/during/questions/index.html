<h3>Answer questions</h3>

<p align="justify">During a contest, contestants can ask questions to
the judges. Once a question is submitted, it is automatically numbered
and it appears in the overall <tt>Questions</tt> list as well as in
the <tt>Pendings</tt> list.

<p align="justify">The judges can answer the questions by doing the following: 

<ol>
<li><p align="justify"><b>Access the wording for the question:</b> this is done
by clicking on the link associated with the question number.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Decide on the type of reply:</b> the judges have the following options:

<ol>
<li> compose an answer and mark the reply as <tt>answered</tt>;
<li> mark the reply as <tt>already answered</tt>, meaning that the answer has been given before;
<li> mark the reply as <tt>without answer</tt>, meaning that the question will not be answered.
</ol>
</ol>

<p align="justify">Notice that all questions and corresponding answers are
accessible to all contestants.

<p align="justify">Judges can also broadcast comments to all
contestants. To do this:

<ol>
