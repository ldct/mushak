<h3>Reevaluate submissions</h3>

<p align="justify">Sometimes, a submission may have not been properly
evaluated (lack of system resources) or its result is dubious or even
an error in a test case was found and corrected, and therefore the
judges must reevaluate it.

<p align="justify">To reevaluate a submission, the judges must do the following:


<ol>
<li><p align="justify"><b>Open the submision report:</b> by clicking on the submission number; there may be more then one report.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Choose to reevaluate:</b> by clicking on the <tt>Reevaluate</tt> button; The new report is automatically displayed.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Confirm or modify the initial evaluation:</b> and make it final.

</ol>
