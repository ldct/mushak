<h3>Confirm listings delievery</h3>

<p align="justify">This task does not apply to online contests.

<p align="justify">During a contest, contestants may print programs
listings that must be quickly delievered to their desk (you need
helpers for this task). For each listing made (or printout), mooshak
prints a header page with the contestant name, assigns it a number and
includes it in the <tt>Printouts</tt> list. 

<p align="justify">Once a printout is handed
in, the header page should be returned to the judges. The judges can
then mark it as having been delievered. This allows for
teams to check whether their printouts have not been wrongly delievered
as they must hold them in case they have been marked as delievered.

<p align="justify">To mark a printout as delievered, the judges have to:


<ol>
<li><p align="justify">Open the <tt>Pendings</tt> list or the
<tt>Printouts</tt> list;

<li><p align="justify">Choose the printout to be marked: by clicking on its number;

<li><p align="justify">and then marking it as delievered.

</ol>
