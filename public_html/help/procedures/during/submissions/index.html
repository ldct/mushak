<h3>Validate submissions</h3>

<p align="justify">Once a submission is made by a contestant, it is
automatically evaluated by the judging system, it is numbered and
appears in the overall submissions as well as in the pendings list.

<p align="justify">For the person judges to validate a submission they must do the following:

<ol>
<li><p align="justify"><b>Open the submission report:</b> this is done
by clicking on the link associated with the submission number.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Compare obtained and expected results:</b>
the report shows, side by side, the results that were exepected and
those obtained with the submitted program. By looking at these, the
judges can confirm the submission and making it final, or else to
revise the classification made by the system.

</ol>
