<h3>Rules to rank teams:</h3>

Mooshak uses the rules defined by the ACM-ICPC committee to rank
contestants at contests.

<ol>
<li> <p align="justify">The team that solved most problems is
ranked first. 

<li> <p align="justify">Teams that solved the same number of problems
are ranked by the least total time.

<li> <p align="justify">The total time is the sum of the time consumed
for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the
time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the
accepted run plus 20 minutes for each rejected run. There is no time
consumed for a problem that is not solved.
</ol>
