<h3>International Programming Contests</h3>

<p align="justify">The ACM International Collegiate Programming
Contest is a programming world championship for college students
organized and conducted yearly by the ACM. It started in 1970 as a
local contest somewhere in Texas and has since grown exponentially in
the number of participating universities each year. The numbers are
impressive: in 2000 there were more then 2700 teams, from 1079
universities, 70 countries, participating in 42 regional contests
distributed among 82 locations.

<p align="justify">The ACM programming contest provides students with
an opportunity to demonstrate and sharpen their problem solving and
computing skills. Apart from the fun of competing (and hopefully
winning), the contest is also an excelent opportunity to make
international contacts in computing science. The Contest is a
two-tiered competition among teams of students representing
institutions of higher education. The winning teams of the regional
contests (held from mid-September to mid-December each year) will go
forward to the contest world finals which are held in the following
Spring.

<p align="justify">The Regionals and World Finals usually comprehend a
5-hours programming contest with 8 or 9 problems to be solved by
teams. Teams are composed by upto 3 students and may submit their
program solutions in a number of programming languages, usually:
<b>Pascal</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b> or <b>Java</b>. A submitted
solution is declared as accepted if it successfully produces the same
outputs, for a set of input tests, as those of the jury. The
team that solves more problems in less (accumulated) time,
is declared the winner.

<p align="justify">These events are coordinated by the <a

Collegiate Programming Contests; directed by Professor Bill Poucher),
under the patronage of <a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM</a> and
sponsored world wide by <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>.

<p align="justify">There are other similar contests taking place:

<ul>

<li><p align="justify"><b>Preliminairy contestes:</b> these are contests mainly directed
towards selecting teams for the Regionals; usually take place at
University and/or Country-level.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Online contests:</b> these may be contests
running simulatneously with some other official contest (local or
regional), or is just a team preparation contest. The following sites
frequently organize programming online contests:
<a href="http://acm.uva.es/contests">Valladolid</a> and <a href="http://www.ural.ru">Ural University</a>.

<li><p align="justify"><b>24-hours Judge:</b> these are associated
with sites that function as problem Archives. They allow site members
to submit solutions to the problems in the archive. The members are
ranked by the numbers of problems solved. The following sites are two
of the main problem archivers with a 24-hour judge: <a
href="http://acm.uva.es/problemset">Valladolid</a> and <a
href="http://www.ural.ru">Ural University</a>.
