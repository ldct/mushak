<h3>Reliability</h3>

<p align="justify">A single Mooshak node - one Web server accessible
through a set of Web clients on users machines - is sufficient for
running a small programming contest (i.e. a contest with up to 20
teams) where reliability is not at premium. Running an official
contest, with a concern for reliability and larger number of teams,
distributed in several sites, and a simultaneous online contest,
requires a more complex setup, with a network of interconnected nodes.

<p align="justify">A link from a node X towards a node Y, represents
the direction in which contest data must be replicated (from server X
to server Y). The main reasons for replicating contest data between
Mooshak servers are to support:

<ul>
<li><p align="justify"><b>System Backup:</b> replication is used to
maintain a backup system, with an updated version of the contest data,
so that it can replace one of the servers in case of hardware failure.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Online Contest:</b> replication propagates the
contest data to a server with Internet access used to maintain an
online contest simultaneously with an official local contest.

<li><p align="justify"><b>Load balancing:</b> several servers
distribute load among them and replicate their data to the others. In
this case each server is assigned to a set of users, for instance,
contestants to a server and jury to another, or contestants in
different rooms to different servers.

<li><b>Multi-site contest:</b> This case is similar to the previous
but servers are in distant locations.
</ul>

<p align="justify">The Mooshak network configuration for a particular
contest may contain several of these links. The following figure 
represents the network for a contest taking place simultaneously in
two sites, A and B, the first using two servers (Server A1 and Server
A2) for load balancing and the last using just one server (Server
B). Each site has a backup with an updated version of the contest
data, capable of replacing any of the main servers in case of
failure. Site A maintains also an online version of the contest where
anyone on the Internet can compete against the official contestants
physically located at either site A or at site B. Some nodes are
connected in unidirectional links, such as those connecting servers
with the backup nodes or online-contest servers, and other are
bidirectional, such as those connecting contest servers among them.

<p align="justify">The Mooshak replication uses the <b>rsync</b>
remote-update protocol. This protocol updates differences between two
sets of files over a network link, using an efficient checksum-search
algorithm. The replication procedure is invoked frequently to
propagate changes to other servers, typically every 60 seconds, and
copies only the data that has been changed since the last
replication. The object files produced by the compilation of programs
are not replicated, just the evaluation reports. If necessary the
programs may be reevaluated in a different machine.

<p align="justify">The main issue with replication is the consistency
of contest data, namely that no data fails to be replicated or is
overwritten by replicated data. To guarantee that no data fails to be
replicated we must ensure that there is a replication path connecting
all servers interfacing with official contestants.

<p align="justify">To address the problem of data being overwritten,
we must differentiate between contest definition data (such teams,
problems, programming languages) and contest transactions (such as
submissions, questions and printouts). Of these two, contest
transactions, specially submissions, are particularly important. To
guarantee uniqueness all transaction data is keyed by a timestamp, the
team ID and the problem ID. Thus, if team ID is unique in the system,
and transactions from the same team are consistently sent to the same
server, then there is no danger of losing transactions due to
overwritten data since each transaction key is also unique.

<p align="justify">Contest data is not, in principle, changed after
the beginning of the contest. It should be updated in a single node
for consistency sake, and that node must have a path to every other
node in the network. The only exception to this case is the creation
of teams for online-contest servers, as we allow contestants to
register during the contest. In case of using load balancing for
online-contest servers it is important to assign team creation to a
single server. Otherwise, two teams with the same name, and same
group, registering at same time in different servers could (although
not very likely) share the same record.

<p align="justify">For the above setup to work properly, all servers
clocks must be synchronized. This can be achieved using the Network
Time Protocol (NTP).
