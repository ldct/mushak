<h3>Security</h3>

<p align="justify">One initial security issue is related with the
system support for different types of users with different access
permissions. This is handled by ensuring user authentication and then
associate types of users with different interface views of the system.

<p align="justify">The compilation and the execution of programs are
the two most insecure points of a contest management system. Provided
it fits in a single file, a team can submit virtually any program in
one of the contest languages, including a bogus or malicious program
capable of jeopardizing the system and ruin the contest. For that
reason Mooshak compiles and executes programs in a secure environment,
with the privileges of an insecure user and with several limits. Most
of these limits are independent of problems, with the exception of
execution timeout that is adjusted to each problem. The timeout for
each problem is determined before the contest and it is the maximum
time taken by the judges solutions, with all test cases, rounded up
for the next integer (in seconds). The timeout for compilation is 60
seconds. The other resource limits enforced are listed in the
following table with their default values in bytes (except for the
number of child-processes).<p>
